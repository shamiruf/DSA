### B-Tree
Instances of the Tree class represent a B-tree. Class Tree has functions like contains(key), add(key), remove(key).

### Inter Search
Searches for the index of an element that is between indices first and last.

### Merge Sort
The sorted array is split into two parts of approximately the same size. 
Each of the resulting parts is sorted separately by the same algorithm. Two ordered arrays of half size are combined into one.
